# Mark: A TUI Assistant

Mark is an AI assistant for the Terminal.

Development is currently in exploration mode and is considered alpha stage.

## Usage

### The `.mark` directory

Mark uses a directory called `.mark` in the current directory to keep its
internal state. This allows you to maintain different state per project. You
can also have a global instance that always runs in a global directory
for non project specific tasks.

## Inspiration

The TUI is inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) and
[superfile](https://github.com/yorukot/superfile).
